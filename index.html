                    Hi! My name is Aryan and I am a geospatial enthusiast driven by the transformative potential of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in uncovering critical insights and solutions. 
                    Currently in my second semester of the GIS program at Fanshawe College, I’ve gained hands-on experience in spatial data management, advanced analysis, remote sensing, and cartographic design. 
                    My coursework has honed my proficiency in integrating diverse datasets and employing industry-standard GIS software, empowering me to tackle complex real-world challenges with robust spatial methodologies.

                    This specialization builds on my foundational knowledge from Fanshawe’s Remotely Piloted Aerial Systems course, 
                    where I learned to capture and process aerial imagery, as well as my Aeronautical Engineering background from the Manipal Institute of Technology in India, 
                    which familiarized me with the principles of aviation and aerodynamics. 
                    Bringing these strengths together, I am committed to leveraging both geospatial and aerial technologies to produce meaningful, actionable intelligence for a variety of applications.
